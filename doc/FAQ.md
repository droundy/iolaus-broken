# FAQ

Why would I want to use Iolaus?
-------------------------------

- You're tired of the snappy response git provides, and want something
  that gives you a bit more time to check your email.

- You believe that anything written in Haskell must be better than
  anything written in C.

- You like darcs' user interface and want to use something familiar to
  deal with smallish git repositories.

- You want to experiment with a new git porcelain.

How should I capitalize Iolaus?
-------------------------------

You can either write "Iolaus" or "iolaus", I don't care.  I'm not
particularly consistent myself.

What is your favorite Platonic dialogue?
----------------------------------------

Although I am partial to *Euthydemus*, which has reference to Iolaus,
I must admit that I prefer *Laches*.  It doesn't have the same
side-splitting humor, but I prefer the friendlier atmosphere and the
characters are awesome--especially Laches himself, although Nicias is
pretty cool, too.

Wait... have you really been frequently asked all these questions?!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

No, I just made them up because I wanted to feel more like Socrates.
