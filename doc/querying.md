# Querying local changes

This is an overview of the commands you can use to query the state of
your local repository.  To get more detail about any given command,
just click on its name.

[whatsnew][]
-----------

[Whatsnew][whatsnew] shows you what changes you've made in your
working directory that you haven't yet [recorded][].

[changes][]
----------

[Changes][changes] shows you the changes that you *have*
[recorded][].  I particularly like the output of

    iolaus changes --graph --max-count 6 # or some other reasonable number

show
----

Show is a catch-all for some less commonly used commands that I won't
enumerate here.
