Iolaus
======

There will be an introduction to Iolaus and its ideas here...

"On Lerna's murderous hound, the many-headed hydra, he set his
branding-iron..."

*Herakles*, Euripides

"So he killed it, and in his turn called for help on Iolaus who, by
setting fire to a piece of the neighbouring wood and burning the roots
of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting. Having
thus got the better of the sprouting heads, he chopped off the
immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it, beside the
road that leads through Lerna to Elaeus."

*Apollodorus*, translated by Sir James G. Frazer, 1921.
