> On Lerna's murderous hound, the many-headed hydra, he set his

*Herakles*, Euripides

> ...and in his turn called for help on Iolaus who, by setting fire to
> a piece of the neighbouring wood and burning the roots of the heads
> with the brands, prevented them from sprouting. Having thus got the
> better of the sprouting heads, he chopped off the immortal head, and
> buried it, and put a heavy rock on it, beside the road that leads
> through Lerna to Elaeus.

*Apollodorus*, translated by Sir James G. Frazer, 1921.
